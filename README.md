# üßÆ SQL Analytics Project ‚Äî Store, Sales & Warranty Insights

This project demonstrates advanced SQL analytical queries for retail data analysis, focusing on **sales performance**, **warranty tracking**, **store insights**, and **product trends**.
Each query explores a different real-world business question using **PostgreSQL** functions and concepts such as **aggregations**, **joins**, **window functions**, and **date/time analysis**.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of the following key tables:

* **STORES** ‚Äì Store information including country and store details
* **SALES** ‚Äì Transactional sales data (date, quantity, total price, etc.)
* **PRODUCTS** ‚Äì Product details (name, price, launch date, category)
* **WARRANTY** ‚Äì Warranty claim records
* **CATEGORY** ‚Äì Product category information
